UFO Analysis Report 

1.	Overview of the analysis:
o	The purpose of this assignment is to help Dana to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. Basically, she needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript). 
o	To explain to the readers what they will see when they view the webpage, Dana created filters to make the table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

2.	Results:
o	The webpage has many criterias. One of the criteria is filter which allows viewers to view a specific data on the webpage, in particular the UFO table. To do so, viewers will need to type what data they want to see in the filter search, which is located on top left side of the table. For example, they can filter search by date, city, state, country, and shape and more.

o	Let’s say that we want to see UFO sights in the city of Falcon.  We go to filter search under “Enter a city, we type in Falcon, and this is what we will see.

3.	Summary:

o	In my opinion, the drawback is that the table should be in a cell, like in Excel, and not just a line diving each row. And that the entire webpage should be more colorful.
o	My two recommendation are that the table should be a bit more colorful and fun, and that viewers should be able use the filter search to look up more that one data at the same time. For example, if a viewer wants to search for two countries at the same time, they should be able to do so. Let’s look at the table below as an example.
